# Web search

Findx is an independent search engine from Europe and a true crawler-based search engine. You can keep your searches private - your search history isn't saved, and the results we display are from our own index and crawler.

Findx is still in an early phase - our index is not yet “complete”. Search results may not be the most comprehensive. We simply haven’t had enough time to crawl everywhere, but our index is growing rapidly!

If you find something odd, and you will, please let us know, either by using the [ranking feature on Findx](/en/helpimprovesearch), or by telling us in our [online forum](https://forum.privacore.com)
