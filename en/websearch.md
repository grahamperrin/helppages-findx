Findx is an independent search engine from Europe
Findx is a true search engine where you can keep searching in private, this means your search history isn't saved, and the results we find is from our own index and crawler.

Findx is still in an early phase - our index is not yet “complete”. Search results may not be the most comprehensive. We simply haven’t had enough time to crawl everywhere. You can sign up for beta access  and follow how our independent index is growing.

If you find something odd, and you will. Please let us now, etiher by using the [ranking feature on findx](/en/helpimprovesearch), or by telling us in our [online forum](https://forum.privacore.com)
