# Timer

In the search field box type "timer" followed by the length of time you want to set it to - for example: 10sec, or 10min, or 10hr.

The timer will start counting down immediately. The countdown indicator turns into a green tick and wiggles when your time is up.

Click Reset to turn off the visual notification when you don't want to restart the timer immediately.

**Restart the timer**: Click the green tick and it will start counting down immediately.

**Set multiple timers**: Click the plus next to the first timer, set the times you want to count down, and then the 'play' symbol to start the timer.

**Note**: You need to leave the tab with the Findx timer active for it to continue counting down. Simply pull the tab of your browser out into its own window.
