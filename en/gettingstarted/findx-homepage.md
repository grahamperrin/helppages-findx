Additional home page settings are available in Preferences:

* Click the **menu icon** and select **Preferences**.
* Using the drop-down menu, you can choose to have Privafox show a blank page on startup, or show all of the windows and tabs from your previous session.
* You can also set multiple pages as your home page. To do this, open each page you want to open when you start the browser in a separate tab and click on **Use Current Pages**.
