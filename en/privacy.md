# Private search

# What does a private search engine do differently?
Firstly, we doesn’t save your search history, and it doesn’t match the searches you make to your computer or phone. Private search engines don’t set cookies to track your footsteps across the web, so we can’t build a profile on you and haunt you with personalised ads.

# How we handle cookies to remember your settings?

Cookies are small files that store your site preferences and history. Websites save cookies onto your computer so that when you return, you can pick up where you left off. 

## No cookies by default
By default, findx doesn't need cookies to work, but for your convenience you can save your personal settings, this requires cookies.  

## Cookies for settings
findx saves settings cookies (in a folder called findx.com) that remembers your site preferences only - not your history. This makes it easier for you to use the service. 

For example, the cookie will remember your language settings, whether you want to open the results you select in a new tab, and more.

The settings cookies will be deleted after 90 days.

Here is an example of a language cookie from findx:
