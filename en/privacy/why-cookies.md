# Why store a cookie that remembers your settings?

Cookies are small files that store your site preferences and history. Websites save cookies onto your computer so that when you return, you can pick up where you left off. 

By default, Findx doesn't need cookies to work, but for your convenience you can save your personal settings, this requires cookies.  

Findx saves settings cookies (in a folder called findx.com) that remembers your site preferences only - not your history. This makes it easier for you to use the service. 

For example, the cookie will remember your language settings, whether you want to open the results you select in a new tab, and more.

The settings cookies will be deleted after 90 days.

Here is an example of a SafeSearch cookie from Findx:
