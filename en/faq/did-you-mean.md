# Does findx have a "Did you mean..." autocorrect feature?

Findx does have a "Did you mean..." autocorrect feature. It was implemented July 2017. 

Due to the high demand from the eople using Findx, we've decide to take a shortcut. With limited time and ressources to build our own we've implemented the Bing outorrect feature. Findx still keeps searches private, and doesn't collect or share personal information with thirdparties.
