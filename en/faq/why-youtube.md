# Why does findx use YouTube videos?


YouTube is the world’s largest repository of free online videos. We include YouTube results in our video search for this reason. 


Browsing thumbnail previews of videos on findx is private. However, watching YouTube videos requires a direct connection to YouTube’s servers. Therefore, it’s impossible for the service to ensure user anonymity.


By default, findx notifies you of this by displaying the message "WARNING: Browsing video thumbnails on findx is private, but the video cannot be watched anonymously.”


To change the default video playback settings, see the help article on [Video Playback](#).
