# How do findx earn money  
We've based our earnings on a well known model, of displaying ads related to the search queries. To create transparency about it we mark it clearly when you see an ad or find an affiliate result.  
_Example: _When you search for Tennis, we can show you an ad for a pair of tennis shoes - no need to know your previous searches for that.

## Contextual ads from partners
We never disclose your IP address or other information that can identify you to our partners. We only let them see the search term, your geographical region (country/state) and language. If you click the ad, you are of course in their hands (and so is your IP address), but you search in complete privacy until you click.

## Affiliate deals
We are affiliates of some of the larger online shops, and may attach our affiliate ID to the links you see in our search results (clearly marked with a green "Aff" icon). If you decide to buy something from our partnerâ€™s site, we get a small commission that helps us to continue providing our services to you. We do not receive any information about what you buy.

## Other opportunities

### Business to business - API requests
Since we have our own index we have the option to offer paid API access, and we are planning to start offering that end of 2017 or early 2018.

### Consumer services - Paid services
Following the market closely and researching if people are willing to pay for a service, especially on mobile devices, might be an option, but it is too early to say. Among the ideas we discuss is an ad-free mobile app.
