# How does Findx earn money  

We are using a well-known and well-accepted model of displaying ads related to your search queries. To be transparent, we mark ads and results with affiliate links clearly.  
_Example_: When you search for **tennis**, we show you an ad for a pair of tennis shoes - no-one needs to know your previous searches to show you related ads.

## Contextual ads from partners

We never disclose your IP address or any other information that can identify you to our partners. We only let them see the search term, your geographical region (country/state) and language. If you click the ad, you are of course in their hands (and so is your IP address), but you will search in complete privacy until you click through to the advertiser's website.

## Affiliate deals

We are affiliates of some of the larger online shops, and may attach our affiliate ID to the links you see in our search results (clearly marked with a green "Aff" icon). If you decide to buy something from our partners' sites, we receive a small commission that helps us to continue providing our services to you. We do not receive any identifying information about what you buy.

## Other opportunities

### Business to business - API requests

Since we have our own index we have the option to offer paid API access, and we are planning to start offering this service during 2018.

### Consumer services - Paid services

Following the market closely and researching if people are willing to pay for a service, especially on mobile devices, might be an option, but it is too early to say. Among the ideas we are discussing is an ad-free mobile app.
