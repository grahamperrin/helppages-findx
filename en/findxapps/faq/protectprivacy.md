# How do you protect my privacy?

The Findx apps have several features which protect your privacy.

- [Findx (a private, independent, European search engine)](http://get.findx.com) is the default search engine in both the desktop and mobile apps - all of your searches remain anonymous and private.
- Your [browsing history is never saved](/en/findxapps/faq/browsinghistory) when you exit the Findx app. Each time you open the Findx app, it is as if it's the first time - no one can see where you've been online.
- [Form data is never saved](/en/findxapps/faq/formdata), it is forgotten as soon as you have entered it.

You have control over who sees your data, and what data is stored on your device when you use Findx.
