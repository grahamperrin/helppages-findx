# Why is Findx the default search engine?

Findx is an independent, private search engine which is hosted in Denmark. The Findx apps and extensions were developed by the same people who have developed the Findx private search engine.

All searches on Findx are private and your search history is not stored, which is why Findx is the default search engine within the Findx apps.

Some of the features of Findx include:
- Private search
- Anonymous quality rating of search results
- Private shopping search
- Private image search
- Private video search
- Private map search and route planning
- Instant answers, based purely on your search terms
