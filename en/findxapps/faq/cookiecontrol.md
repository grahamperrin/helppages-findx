# What does the built in Cookiecontroller do?

Cookiecontrol gives you complete control of the cookies stored in your browser. It provides you with a detailed overview of the cookies used by each website. 

You can protect cookies from websites you regularly visit: You might want to save your login, or be able to see what's in your shopping basket the next time you go to the site. This information is typically saved in cookies.

You can toggle settings to allow or disallow first-party and third-party cookies easily.
