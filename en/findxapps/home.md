# Findx apps for desktop and mobile

Findx apps help you keep your secrets to yourself by ensuring your online activities are private. They stop third-party trackers, block ads, and delete your search history, automatically. 

## Findx mobile apps

Findx mobile is based on a lightning fast, lightweight browser, and has ad-blocking, tracker blocking, search history deletion, and the [private search engine Findx](https://get.findx.com) set by default. Open the Findx app, find what you're searching for and you're done! Much faster than the bloated browsers and webpages saturated with ads and tracking scripts.

## Findx desktop app

The Findx desktop app uses the [Cookiecontroller](/en/findxapps/faq/cookiecontrol) where you can block or allow cookies, and [Privacontrol](/en/findxapps/faq/privacontrol) which gives you complete control over what a website is allowed or not allowed to do. A [master password](/en/findxapps/faq/masterpassword) also protects your bookmarks from prying eyes (and intrusive web scripts!)
