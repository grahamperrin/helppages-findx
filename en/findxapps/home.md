# Findx mobile apps

The Findx mobile apps help you keep your secrets to yourself by ensuring your online activities are private, even on your smartphone. They stop third-party trackers, block ads, and delete your search history, automatically. 

The Findx mobile apps are based on a lightning-fast, lightweight browser, and has ad-blocking, tracker blocking, search history deletion, and the [private search engine Findx](https://get.findx.com) set by default. Open the Findx app, find what you're searching for and you're done! Much faster than the bloated browsers and webpages saturated with ads and tracking scripts.
