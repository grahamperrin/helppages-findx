# Control your privacy

By using the Findx Privacy Control browser extension, you can control who has access to your personal information when you browse the web.

It can be a bit technically complex to know what should be blocked and what is ok. So, we've made it easy. By default, the Findx Privacy Control browser extension uses established blocking lists to block malware, third-party and advertising trackers - anything that contacts a third-party website.

Of course, you don't want to block everything - cookies can make it easier to use a website - for example, to remember your login information, or what is in your shopping basket. This information stays between you and the website you are visiting, so it's usually ok!

## How does it work?

The Findx Privacy Control uses several recommended protection lists - a couple of malware lists and a privacy list are active by default, as well as an ads list which is not enabled by default.

*Tip:* You can [subscribe to additional protection lists or create your own custom protection list](/en/findxapps/privacycontrol/manageprotectionlists) in the Findx Privacy Control settings. 

## See what was blocked by the Findx Privacy Control

Once you have [installed the Findx Privacy Control browser extension](/en/browserplugin), you can see what is blocked on any page you visit.

1. Click the Findx Privacy Control icon next to the search bar or URL field.
2. Click on the details list icon under *Blocked on this site*. 
3. You'll see the different protection lists that are in use, and the number of elements on the page that they have blocked. Click the drop down arrow next to a number to see what exactly was blocked.

### Display blocked content 

You can choose the display each individual element that was blocked - click the round button next to the element and then click the refresh icon that is displayed. The page will be reloaded with the element now displayed.

# Search in private

The Findx Privacy Control browser extension also lets you search in private easily. 

Simply click on the Findx Privacy Control icon and enter your search query, then press Enter. 

Alternatively, click on the *Search* tab where you will find shortcuts to instant answers and various specific search types. 

Whether you have clicked on one of these shortcuts, or entered a search, you'll be taken to Findx.com, and your search results will be displayed. 

Your searches are completely private with Findx!
