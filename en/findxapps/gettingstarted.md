# Getting started

Welcome to the Findx apps and extensions! 

You want to protect your privacy online, and that's exactly what the Findx mobile apps help you to do. The Findx apps don't store your browsing history, they block ads and trackers, and use a private search engine by default. 

The Findx Privacy Control browser extensions give you complete control over your privacy when using a desktop browser - you can choose to block or allow advertisements, trackers or even block entire websites.

We want to help you get the most out of your Findx apps and extensions. If you have any questions, or would like some more information about certain features, please [contact us via our online community](https://forum.privacore.com/index.php?p=/categories/findxapps).
