# Getting started

Welcome to the Findx apps! 

You want to protect your privacy online, and that's exactly what the Findx apps help you to do. The Findx apps don't store your browsing history, the block ads and trackers, protect your bookmarks behind a password, and use a private search engine by default. 

You are in complete control of your privacy online with Findx. 

We want to help you get the most out of your Findx apps. If you have any questions, or would like some more information about certain features, please [contact us via our online community](https://forum.privacore.com/index.php?p=/categories/findxapps).
