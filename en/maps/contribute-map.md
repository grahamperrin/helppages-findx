# Contribute to the map
The Findx map results page uses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM), a crowdsourced map of the world.  Similar to Wikipedia, anyone can contribute to the map. To date, more than three million people have registered as OSM contributors. 


The service maps a wide variety of features, including roads, trails, buildings, swimming pools, playgrounds, and much more. Itâ€™s free and easy to [contribute](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data).


Many apps and websites pull in OSM data and style it to accentuate specific features for a particular audience. That means your contributions will percolate out to the hundreds of millions of people who use OpenStreetMap data every day.
