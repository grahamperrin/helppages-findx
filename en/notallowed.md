# Not allowed to index

Transperency is key to building the findx search engine, and so are relevant results. We have initiated our spiders to crawl the web and collect web pages to create a high quality index. This naturally includes results from wellknown webistes as Yelp and Quora to be found on findx. Unfortunately we have a reply from some websites that the findxbot will not be allowed to index their websites.
We will keep a list of the requests we make, and the result of our requests.
