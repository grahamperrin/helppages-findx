# Findx online help
Findx is a new search engine from Europe. Our goal is to create a truly independent search engine, and let people find information, in private.

**Findx lets you:**

- Search the web in private, without collecting data about your online activities
- Search for products, images and videos in private
- Find locations and plan routes in private  

**Findx does not:**

- Profile your behaviour by collecting IP addresses or device information
- Know what you did last summer
