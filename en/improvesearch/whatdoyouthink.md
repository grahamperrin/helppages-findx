# Comment on the relevance of search results

The search results that Findx returns depends on what we have in our index, our ranking algorithm and a number of external factors. At times, you may encounter some searches return results that may not be relevant. You can help make Findx better by sending us a message saying what you think about the results.

Findx registers and validates all feedback submitted. The amount of time it takes to review and update a result will depend on the total number of pending suggestions.
