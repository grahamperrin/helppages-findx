# Improve a result

The information findx returns about a Web page is only as good as what the webmaster enters. At times, you may encounter very general page titles and descriptions that don't tell you much. You can help make findx better by improving the title and description for a result.


Anyone can improve a search result. To do this:


1. Click on the **comment icon** that appears to the far right of the result. The Improve on this result dialog will open.
2. Under **"How could the title for this result be better?,"** edit the title, if necessary.
3. Under **"What will describe the content of this result better?,"** edit the description, if necessary. 
4. Click **SEND**.

findx registers and validates all improvements submitted. The amount of time it takes to review and update a result will depend on the total number of pending suggestions.


Eventually, we plan to make suggested improvements public, so that webmasters can see if their sites are listed for improvement. We will also list the changes made to a result publicly.
