# Change search engine in your browser
You can easily make findx the deafult search engine in most used browsers. This can be done by installing an [add-on for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/) or a plugin from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/)

## Private search add-on for Firefox
To add findx as the default search engine:  
  1. Go to [Mozilla add-on store and find findx](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/findx/).  
  2. Click the **Add to Firefox** button.  
  3. Click **Install"** to start the installation. 
  4. Click **OK** to confirm.
  5. Your browser will then ask you to restart
