# Manage protection lists

You can see and change the protection lists that you are using at any time.

1. Click on the Findx Privacy Control icon.
2. Click on the gear icon at the top right.

You'll see which protection lists are in use, which are enabled by default (green), their names, which Group they belong to and when they were last updated. 

## Add or remove protection lists

You can add or remove protection lists (also known as filters) at any time. You can even [add your own custom protection list](/en/privacycontrol/mytrackingfilter).

* Choose a protection list to add from the drop down list of available filter subscriptions, then click Add. 

Your selected protection list will be added and marked as **In Use**. But it is not enabled by default.

## Enable or disable protection lists by default

Protection lists that are enabled by default are green. 

- Click the green/red toggle for your selected protection list to enable or disable it by default.

## Stop using a protection list

Perhaps you've found a protection list interferes too much with the websites you typically visit. 

- Click the trash icon to the left of the list you want to stop using and remove.

## Turn off the auto-update for protection lists

- Deselect the checkbox next to Auto-update filter lists. 

If you have disabled the auto-update, we recommend that you periodically manually update the lists - simply click **Update Now**.

## Use element hiding filters

There are some elements in web pages that can't easily be blocked by the usual filter lists. You can enable or disable the cosmetic filters to hide or display these elements. 

- Click on the checkbox to **Parse and enforce cosmetic filters**
