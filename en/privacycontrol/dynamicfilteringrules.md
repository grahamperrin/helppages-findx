# Dynamic filtering rules

You can enter detailed rules to block or allow specific elements or trackers on web pages. 

We'd recommend you do this only if you are comfortable using [uBlock's rule syntax](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-rule-syntax).

1. Click **Edit** to start editing the Temporary rules. Add or remove the rules in the text box beneath the buttons. 
2. Click **Save** to save your new Temporary rules, then, if you want to make your changes permanent, click **Commit**. 

If you have a file with a list of rules, you can import it easily by clicking on **Import**.
