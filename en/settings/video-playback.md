# Video Playback

This setting allows you to specify what you want to happen when you click on the thumbnail preview for a video result. This is important because, while yor video thumbnail browsing activity on findx is private, videos can't be watched anonymously. 


By default, findx notifies you of this by displaying the message "WARNING: Browsing video thumbnails on findx is private, but the video cannot be watched anonymously."


There are three video playback options:


* Ask me - findx will prompt you to choose an action each time (the default setting)
* Watch on findx - the video will play on the findx search results page
* Watch on source site - findx will redirect you to the original website, and then play the video



To change the setting:


1. Click the **menu icon** to open the findx menu.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Click the **Privacy** tab.
4. Next to **Video Playback**, click on **Ask me** (the default) to open the drop-down menu and view all available actions. Select an action. 
5. At the bottom of the page, click **Save and Exit**.


You can also change the setting directly from the search results page by clicking on a video thumbnail, checking the **Remember my choice** box, and choosing either **Watch Here** or **Watch on YouTube**.
