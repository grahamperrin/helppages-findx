### Show search results in your language

### Location/Language Auto-detection

Findx can automatically determine the country you're located in so that it can give you the best results. 

**Example: You're in London, and prefer UK results.**  

Your browser is set to English, but English language results can be from all over the world. In order to give you the most relevant information, findx will automatically determine your location and show you UK results.

### How does Findx automatically select my language?  
Geographical location (country) is determined before you search Findx through a geo-lookup service that's based on your IP address. Findx uses this geographic information and your browser language to set the defaults for its interface and search results.   

Findx doesn't save your IP address, and can't link it with your searches.
