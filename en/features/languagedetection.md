### Location/Language Auto-detection

findx automatically determines the country you're located in so that it can give you the best results. 


***Example:  
You're in London, and prefer UK results.***  


Your browser is set to English, but English language results can be from all over the world. In order to give you the most relevant information, findx will determine your location and show you UK results.

### How does findx automatically select my language?  
Geographical location (country) is determined before you search findx through a geo-lookup service that's based on your IP address. findx uses the geographic information and your browser language to set the defaults for its interface and search results.   


findx doesn't know or save your IP address, and can't associate it with your searches.
