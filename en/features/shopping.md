# Shopping search?
To search for products to purchase in private with Findx:
 
1. Search for the product you’re interested in.
2. Click the **Shopping** tab.
3. Your results will appear as a list by default. You can also click **View as Grid** for a gallery-style view of your results. This option allows you to preview shopping results without leaving Findx.
4. Click on a product name (in list view) or the **View Product** link (in grid view) to exit Findx and visit the product page on the retailer’s site. 

Your searches and result previews are private. However, once you select a product (step 4 above), you will leave Findx, and privacy will be handled according to the terms of the new website. Read more [about privacy](/en/about-privacy) at Findx.


Findx currently gets its shopping results from eBay, but will be adding more retailers in the future.
