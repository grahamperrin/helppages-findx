# "Did you mean..." autocorrect feature

Findx does have a "Did you mean..." autocorrect feature. It was implemented July 2017, after a high demand from the beta launch. 

With limited time and resources to build our own, we've implemented the Bing autocorrect feature. Findx still keeps searches private, and doesn't collect or share personal information with Bing or other third parties.
