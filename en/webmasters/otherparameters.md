# Parameters for crawling and ranking

## How often does Findxbot re-spider a website?  
Generally we aim for re-spidering every 7-10 days for front pages. In practice, it varies depending on the system load, especially while we are in beta.  

## XML sitemap support
XML sitemaps are not supported, yet.  

## How does Findxbot handle canonical links?
If canonical is indicated, Findxbot will only spider the canonical link (and drop the non-canonical link).  

## Does page speed matter?  
Findxbot has time to wait for slow websites: Currently page load speed is not a parameter for indexing or ranking. 

## Is HTTPS better than HTTP?  
HTTPS vs HTTP is an option we can use while ranking the results, but currently it is not enabled.
